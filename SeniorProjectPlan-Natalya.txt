CIS 4914 Project Plan

Project: Mobile and Web Application for Storing Collections
Student: Natalya Hankewych
UFID[5-8]: 9690
Date of Approval: 12/3/13

Statement of Work:

Task 1. Develop an Android Application

Design the layouts for each of the following screens: logging in/signing up, viewing a list of collections, viewing the items of an individual collection, viewing an individual item in a collection, browsing other peoples' collections by category, creating a new collection, and editing an existing collection. Use dummy data and store all user-uploaded content client-side.


Task 2. Connect app to a Server-Side Database

Using MongoDB, come up with a non-relational "schema" for a database to store all of the application's data. Set up API routes using Pymongo to allow the application to interact with the database.


Task 3. Create a Website

My project partner Kevin Gonzalez will make a website that has the same functionality as the Android application. Together, we will connect the website to the Mongo database.


Task 4. Write a Final Report


*Deliverables:

1. Android Application: source code on GitHub, final product can be delivered as an APK file or possibly downloadable from the Google Play Store

2. MongoDB backend: source code on GitHub

3. Web Application: source code on GitHub, viewable on a website whose domain name is TBD

4. Final Report: soft copy emailed to advisor and coordinator, hard copy to be printed and delivered to advisor and coordinator
